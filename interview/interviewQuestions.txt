object.assign()
object.is(obj)
Object.defineProperty()
call stack, event loop
Obfuscation ? => machine code (code size reduce, fast transfer, hide business logic, complex read)
Encryption => unreadable form 
Minification => removing unneccessary char (save bandwidth and loading time)

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 100

PWA, app shell model?
submit form =>  document.form[0].submit();
DOMContentLoaded => html loaded
document load => html, css assets
BOM => objects navigator, history, screen, location and document
polyfill =>provide modern functionality on older browsers
tree shaking => form of dead code elimination, implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.
js lebel => named loop
How do you print the contents of web page => window.print()
void 0 => prevent page refresh
undefined +1 = Nan
null +1 = 1


function argument => argument.length
function parameter => function.length


XMLHttpRequest = synchronous http req
xmlHttpReq.open( "GET", theUrl, false ); // false for synchronous request
asynchronous =>xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous

NaN =>
Math.sqrt(-1)
parseInt("Hello")

double exclamation - boolean value

web worker - postMessage(), terminate(), onmessage, onfetch event

event delegation -technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.
var form = document.querySelector('#registration-form');
// Listen for changes to fields inside the form
form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {
// Log the field that was changed
console.log(event.target);
}, false);



SSE notification - EventSource obj, source.onmessage , onopen, onerror

What is a storage event and its event handler
  The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document.
  Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events
  window.onstorage = functionRef;
  
  window.onstorage = function(e) {
    console.log('The ' + e.key +
    ' key has been changed from ' + e.oldValue +
    ' to ' + e.newValue + '.');
  };

memoization - used cache otherwise calculate
post message - enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.

1. why Immediately Invoked Function Expression?
  data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e,
  If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,
  (function ()
          {
            var message = "IIFE";
            console.log(message);
          }
  )
  ();
  console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined

2 why memoization 
increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results.

3. why closures?

4. Cookie
  Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile
  key value pair, expire time set, path set, delete Cookie by setting previous time

5. promise?
  async task

6. callbacks?
  js event driven That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
  callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.
function firstFunction(){
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log('First function called');
  }, 1000 );
}
function secondFunction(){
  console.log('Second function called');
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output
// Second function called
// First function called

7. why promise.race()
which is firstly resolved or rejected. (which is faster we can identify)

8. why JSON - data exchange
